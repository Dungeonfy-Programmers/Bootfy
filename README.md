## What is this?
This is an app that makes it easy to start a local server. Not just that, it picks the server for you: Dungeonfy! This is an app that downloads Dungeonfy and all required server software for it to work.

## Why?
Dungeonfy as we know it is gone. The server it was on is no longer up, but we have the server files. So, this program allows you to play the server by yourself. It means that people who want to play the server don't have to navigate the scary command line (Windows users are so lazy /j) and can just play the game.
